## Parse content

This message is a request to the plugin to parse the provided content containing one or more pipeline configurations. GoCD will send this request to the plugin in order to validate the pipeline configurations as part of a preflight check. It is very similar to the [`parse-directory`](#parse-directory) request except that it is not dependent on an existing config repo or a specific directory of files.
