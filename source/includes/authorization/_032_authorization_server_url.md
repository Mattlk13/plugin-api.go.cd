## Authorization Server URL

This is a message that a web based plugin should implement. A web based plugin uses an external authorization server for authentication. For this request the plugin should return the URL of the external authorization server to which GoCD redirects the user for authentication.

| `authorization_server_url` | `String` | The external authorization server URL to which GoCD redirects the user for authentication.                                                                                     |
| `auth_session`             | `Object` | A flat object/dictionary with string keys and values that will be stored against the users session and passed back to the plugin when [fetching the access token](#fetch-access-token). (optional) |

The plugin is expected to return status `200` if it can understand the request.

The `auth_session` field can be used to store some state against the user who is initiating the login flow. This state, if provided, will then be subsequently passed back to the plugin when [fetching an access token](#fetch-access-token). The main purpose for this is to allow the plugin to later verify that the user who initiated the login flow is the same one who is completing it in redirect-based authentication flows.

For example, a plugin could store a random value which it expects the authorization server to reflect back to the GoCD server in HTTP request parameters after the user has authenticated with the external server later redirecting to the GoCD server. During [Fetch Access Token](#fetch-access-token) the plugin can compare contents of the `auth_session` to the request parameters, or use them in fetching the access token to provide additional security mitigations. 

A specific example within redirect flows are the *OAuth2*  `state` and the *OIDC* `nonce` parameters which if supported by the authorization server/identity provider are generally generated by the client relying party (GoCD in this case) prior to redirecting to the external server, and then validated after redirect back to the relying party. For `state` this would be done by comparing a generated value stored within the `auth_session` pre-redirect to a request parameter post-redirect. For the `nonce` by storing within the `auth_session` and then comparing to that within the returned ID token by the external authorization server.
